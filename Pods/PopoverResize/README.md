**PopoverResize** adds the ability to resize a NSPopover.  It shows resize icons when you hover over the edges of the popover window, indicating to the user they can resize.

This is how it looks within my app, Library Express:

### How to use PopoverResize

1\. Import the framework:
```swift
@import PopoverResize
```
2\. Create the PopoverResize instance, giving it a minimum and maximum size. The CGFloat(0) indicates to use the current screen's height.

```swift
let min = NSSize(width: CGFloat(150), height: CGFloat(50))
let max = NSSize(width: CGFloat(800), height: CGFloat(0))
popover = PopoverResize(min: min, max: max)
```

3\. Set the content view controller for the popup.

```swift
popover.setContentViewController(ViewController.create())
```

4\. Set a callback for the resized event

```swift
popover.resized {(size: NSSize) in
    print("Popover resized: \(size)")
}
```

See the PopoverResizeSample app for a complete example.
